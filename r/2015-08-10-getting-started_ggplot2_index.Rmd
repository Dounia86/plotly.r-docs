# Plotly for R

Plotly is an R package for creating interactive web-based graphs via [plotly](https://plot.ly/)'s JavaScript graphing library, `plotly.js`.

The `plotly` R libary contains the `ggplotly` function , which will convert `ggplot2` figures into a Plotly object. 

Furthermore, you have the option of manipulating the Plotly object with the `style` function.

#### Installation

Plotly is now on CRAN!


```r
install.packages("plotly")
```

Or install the latest development version (on GitHub) via devtools:


```r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
```

RStudio users should download the latest RStudio release for compatibility with htmlwidgets.

#### Initialization for Offline Plotting

By default, Plotly for R runs locally in your web browser or in the R Studio viewer.


```r
library(plotly)

set.seed(100)
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]

p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(text = paste("Clarity:", clarity)), size = 4) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = cut, fill = cut)) + facet_wrap(~ cut)

fig <- ggplotly(p)

fig
```

Simply printing the Plotly object will render the chart locally in your web browser or in the R Studio viewer.

Plotly graphs are interactive. Click on legend entries to toggle traces, click-and-drag on the chart to zoom, double-click to autoscale, shift-and-drag to pan.
